# Yuta v1: Automated Problem Submission Bot for Codforces

## Introduction
You may have seen accounts that claim to have solved over 8000 problems in 10 days, or 9000 problems in weeks. Obviously, these are bots. Ever wonder how they are built? So, I built one using Selenium.

## Technical Details
Yuta v1 is a Python 3.10 script that automates problem submission on Codforces using Selenium and Beautiful Soup. Ensure you have both libraries installed; no other libraries are required. With good internet speed, it submits around 150 problems in 30 minutes.

## Features
- Automates problem submission on Codforces.
- Utilizes Python 3.10, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup.
- Can be further optimized with threading or multiprocessing.
- Potential for improvements like IP rotating and captcha bypassing.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed.
2. Install Selenium and Beautiful Soup libraries.
3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for Selenium (e.g., ChromeDriver).
4. Clone the repository.
5. Update the WebDriver path in the script.
6. Enter your Codeforces username and password in the script.
7. Run the script using `python yuta_v1.py`.

## Disclaimer
Yuta v1 is solely intended for demonstration and educational purposes. Usage of this bot for actual problem submission on Codforces or any other platform is strictly prohibited and may violate terms of service.

## Conclusion
Yuta v1 provides insight into the world of automated problem submission on Codforces. While it's a basic implementation, there's room for improvement and further customization. Have fun exploring and experimenting with it!
